I am a robotics algorithm engineer at Tsinghua University High-Tech Laboratory, Beijing, China. From 2023 to the present, I have been working on robot algorithm development in the laboratory. I obtained my master's degree in control science and engineering from Northeastern University, China, from 2020 to 2023. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in measurement and control technology and instrumentation from Northeast Electric Power University, China, from 2015 to 2019.

<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! -->
